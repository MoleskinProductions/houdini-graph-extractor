= Anti-Aliased Noise =

"""Generates anti-aliased noise by using the derivative information of the incoming position to compute band-limited noise."""

This operator generates anti-aliased (fractional brownian motion) noise
by using the derivative information of the incoming position to compute
band-limited noise. This type of noise is ideal for shading.

@inputs

::pos:
    #type: Vector3
    The position at which to evaluate the noise.

::freq:
    #type: Float
    Frequency of the noise.

@outputs

::noise:
    #type: Float
    The resulting noise value.

::dNdP:
    #type: Vector3
    Analytical derivative of the noise.
