"""Scatters new points randomly across a surface or through a volume."""

== Overview ==

This node distributes new points across the surface in a roughly uniform pattern and optionally attempts to limit clumping and holes.

== Making scattered points stick on changing geometry == (stick)

If the input to the Scatter node changes on each frame, the output point positions and point numbers may change randomly from frame to frame.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Group of primitives on which to generate points.

Generate:
    #id: generateby

    The overall approach to use when generating points.

    By Density:
        Points will be distributed independently based on having a density over each primitive.
    Count per Primitive:
        Exactly the number of points specified will be generated on each primitive.
    In Texture Space:
        Points will first be scattered into the unit square of texture space.

Density Scale:
    #id: densityscale
    #channels: /densityscale

    Value or multiplier indicating the density of points to generate.

Force Total Count:
    #id: npts

    When enabled, exactly this many points will be generated.

~~~ Distribution ~~~

Relax Iterations:
    #id: relaxiterations

    When enabled, points will be relaxed, pushed away from each other.

Max Relax Radius:
    #id: maxradius

    Maximum radius within which points will influence other points.

~~~

Point Attributes:
    #id: pointattribs

    These point attributes will be interpolated from the input geometry.
