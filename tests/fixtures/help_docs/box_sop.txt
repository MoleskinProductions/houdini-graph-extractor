"""Creates a cube or six-sided rectangular box."""

TIP:
    If you connect geometry to the Box SOP's input, it will create a
    bounding box around the input geometry.

@parameters
    Primitive Type:
        Type of geometry to create.

        Polygon:
            Construct the box from size quadrilateral polygons.
        Polygon mesh:
            Construct the box from a mesh of smaller polygons.
        NURBS:
            Construct the box from six NURBS surfaces.

    Size:
        #channels: /sizex /sizey /sizez

        Size of the box along xyz axes.
    Center:
        #channels: /tx /ty /tz

        Position of center of box.
    Rotate:
        #channels: /rx /ry /rz

        Rotation about the center of the box.
    Uniform Scale:
        #channels: /scale

        Uniform scaling.
